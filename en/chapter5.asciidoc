Using the **Moneta**, will happen an exception with the error to try sum money with currencies distinct. It is a “right error” once the dollar, not necessarily, has the value of one Brazilian real. To do this operation of sum among currencies, it needs first do the exchange rate. The exchange rate is the rate at which one currency will be exchanged for another.
