== Introduction

Many systems of information work with monetary values. However, funnily, concerns about money and currency calculations are just delegated to primitives types like Float, Double and BigDecimal. Some systems with a thorough design have their own implementation of money and currency. But when its a common problem why not have a common solution?

The JSR 354 (Money and Currency API) is a work towards defining an API for this and provides representation about the approach around money and currency.
