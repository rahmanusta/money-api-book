**Chris Sekaran**

I am a passionate Java developer currently working in London for a global payments and e-wallet company. Recently I have started to take a personal interest in the Internet-of-things and how the JVM can be used as a platform for this very future form of living.
In my spare time I am off on a long drive or listening to music.
